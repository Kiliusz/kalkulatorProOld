# KalkulatorProOld

This is a web application designed for HVAC Engineers for calculatting pressure drops in pipelines and for selecting proper size pipes.

## More info

This is fully functionall app used by fellow engineers in my country (Poland). 
I wrote this app code with a view to my own HVAC experience and needs for doing fast calculations regardless of being in office
or at construction site using mobile devices.

Please keep in mind that this was my 1st approach to HTML CSS and JavaScript.
I already have made new version of this app (hence word "old" in name), but I want to keep this a bit messed up code 
to show my learning curve.
