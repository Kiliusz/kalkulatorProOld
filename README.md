## More info

Please keep in mind that this was my 1st approach to HTML CSS and JavaScript.
I already have made new version of this app (hence word "old" in name), but I want to keep this - a bit messed up - code 
to show my learning curve. 

Despite spaghetti bad looking code this is fully functionall app used by fellow engineers in my country (Poland).
